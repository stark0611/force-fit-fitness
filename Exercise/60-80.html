        <h1>1. Running :</h1>
        <video src="video1.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>Running improves the overall functionality of your joints, bones, muscles, and reduces body fat that can be
            hard to lose as you age. Running increases your muscle strength and bone density through repetitive weight
            bearing. As we get a little older, we tend to lose our muscle strength, flexibility, and balance. This is a
            part of life. Fortunately, running after 60 is a terrific way to strengthen our bodies, while improving our
            cardiovascular health.
            <br><br>
            Running every day may have benefits for your health. Studies show that the benefits of running for just 5 to
            10 minutes at a moderate pace (6.0 miles per hour) each day may include:

            reduced risk of death from heart attack or stroke,
            reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,
            lower risk of developing cancer,
            lower risk of developing neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
            While these benefits can be achieved by a minimal amount of daily running, a group of Dutch researchers
            recommends running 2.5 hours per week, or 30 minutes, five days a week to enjoy maximum longevity benefits.

        <h1>2. Cycling :</h1>
        <video src="video2.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>Among these activities, bicycling has gained popularity among the elderly patients. Benefits include
            strengthening muscle groups used in maintaining balance and strength (ie, quadriceps), enjoyment, autonomy,
            and improved cardiovascular function. Regular physical activity is a key factor for counteracting
            age-related decline of physical and cognitive functions. Cycling is an affordable, environmentally friendly
            and convenient form of physical activity that is associated with health and functional benefits, even for
            older adults with chronic conditions
            <br><br>
            Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a
            workout. You will breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature, which will improve
            your overall fitness level.

            The health benefits of regular cycling include:

            increased cardiovascular fitness,
            increased muscle strength and flexibility,
            improved joint mobility,
            decreased stress levels,
            improved posture and coordination,
            strengthened bones,
            decreased body fat levels,
            prevention or management of disease,
            reduced anxiety and depression.

        <h1>3. Push Ups :</h1>
        <video src="video3.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>You could start doing push-ups. A study published in February found that men who can hammer out 40 push-ups
            in one session had a lower risk of heart attacks and cardiovascular disease compared with guys who could do
            only 10 or fewer.Now, these are the average numbers, and as you can see, the amount of push-ups you are able
            to go decreases as you age. Naturally, if at anytime you can do much more, such as 39-47 push-ups as a
            20-29-year-old male, you are considered “good.”

            <br><br>
            Push-ups are a convenient exercise that you can do anywhere. They don’t need equipment or a gym membership.
            You can also adjust them to meet your own physical ability or to target specific muscles.

            Push-ups offer many health benefits, including:
            Burning calories,
            Protecting your shoulders and lower back from injuries,
            Improving your balance and posture,
            Improving your flexibility,
            Improving your performance in sports and athletic activities.

        <h1>4. Sit Ups :</h1>
        <video src="video4.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>In the old days, sit-ups and crunches were the go-to moves to keep your core muscles in good shape. But those
            exercises are not as effective as we once believed. They strengthen only a few muscles, and they pose risks
            for older adults. "They're dangerous because you're pulling on your neck."
            <br><br>
            Sit-ups can benefit your fitness in big ways when done correctly. Below, learn about a few of the biggest
            benefits of sit-ups:
            Core Strength,
            Core Stability and Control,
            Spinal Flexibility,
            Hip Flexor Strength,

        <p>Squats burn calories and might help you lose weight. They also lower your chances of injuring your knees and
            ankles. As you exercise, the movement strengthens your tendons, bones, and ligaments around the leg muscles.
            It takes some of the weight off your knees and ankles.

            <br><br>
            The specific benefits to the body include:

            strengthening the musclesTrusted Source in the legs, including, the quadriceps, calves, and hamstrings,
            strengthening the knee joint,
            burning fat and promoting weight loss,
            strengthening the lower back,

        <p>Actively holding a series of poses will stretch and strengthen your muscles, as well as the tendons and
            ligaments that hold your bones together. Mindful breathing makes it a kind of meditation, too. Yoga can help
            lower your heart rate and blood pressure and relieve anxiety and depression. Check out different styles and
            classes to match your level of fitness and what appeals to you.

            <br><br>
            “The relaxation techniques incorporated in yoga can lessen chronic pain, such as lower back pain, arthritis,
            headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome,” explains Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can also lower blood pressure and reduce
            insomnia.”

            Other physical benefits of yoga include:

            increased flexibility,
            increased muscle strength and tone,

        <h1>7. Tai Chi :</h1>
        <video src="taichi.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>This quiet exercise is sometimes called "moving meditation." You move your body slowly and gently, flowing
            from one position to the next, while you breathe deeply. Not only is it good for balance, it can also
            improve bone and heart health. It may help ease pain and stiffness from arthritis. It might even help you
            sleep better.
            <br><br>

            On a physical level, Tai Chi improves strength, flexibility, aerobic conditioning and balance. It’s been
            proven to improve cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, prevent falls and help people who have
            arthritis.

            There are also immense emotional and mental benefits. The deliberate movements help people to feel more
            relaxed, grounded and present in their bodies. This lowers anxiety, stress and depression; while improving
            memory, focus and sleep.

        <p>If you like to sweat a bit more when you exercise, try jogging to get your heart rate up. As long as you take
            it slow and steady, wear the right shoes, and take walking breaks, your joints should be fine. Soft
            surfaces, like a track or grass, may also help. Pay attention to your calves and hips, with extra stretching
            and strengthening to lessen your chance of injuries.

            <br><br>
            Regular jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:

            help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise,
            strengthen muscles,

        <h1>10. Resistance Band Exercise :</h1>
        <video src="resistanceband.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>A resistance band is an elastic band used for strength training. They are also commonly used in physical
            therapy, specifically by convalescents of muscular injuries, including cardiac rehab patients, to allow slow
            rebuilding of strength.

            <br><br>
            Resistance Training, also known as strength / weight training is based around specific muscles contracting
            against an external resistance. For example dumbbells, resistance bands or even a water bottle – any object
            that leads to the contraction of your muscles. In this article we will specifically talk about Resistance
            Training with a band and its benefits. When Resistance Training is performed repeatedly the outcome of
            increased strength, power, hypertrophy and endurance is more likely to be achieved.

        <h1>11. Pilates Ball Exercise :</h1>
        <video src="pilates.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>Pilates is a system of exercises that tones, aligns, and balances your body’s structure. Its low impact
            approach and emphasis on the core make it a versatile method suitable for everyone. Incorporating the
            stability ball, also known as the Swiss or physio ball, can take your workout to the next level.
            <br><br>
            The unstable surface when using pilates balls forces the Pilates practitioner to use their core muscles, aid
            with back health and injury recovery as well as improving posture and muscle rebalance.
